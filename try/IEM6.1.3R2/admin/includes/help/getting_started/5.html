<br><br>
The next step is to create your email campaign. Here you can create a HTML, text or combined email. It's recommended that you send an email that combines both HTML and Text emails in one. The subscribers email software (eg. Outlook) will then automatically determine which version of your email to read. This means that your HTML emails won't be blocked by subscribers who are using Text based email software to read your email.
<br><br>
You can create your email using the built-in HTML editor or you can upload a pre-made one from your hard drive.
<br><br>
Once you've created your email make sure you send a preview to yourself so you can see exactly how it will look when it's sent out.
