Custom Directory
====================
This directory is intended to be used to customize the application.

The contents of this directory will NOT be updated when you do an upgrade
(apart from this README file and the example files), so any customization
that you've made here will be retained and will overwrote the default
configurations that came with the application.

The included example files (ie. init-path.example.php) is there to give you
an example of what can be customized (and what the variables are).
You will need to copy/create another file with the same name minus the
".example" from their file name (ie. init-path.php).

The available customization will be consolidated and expanded gradually.
