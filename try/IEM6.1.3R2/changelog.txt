  - Fixed an issue that prevented the "Send an email to contacts who match my search criteria in the selected list(s) below"  option to autoload to the next page without being able to select matching contacts.
  - Fixed an issue where survey responses were failing to be recorded if a survey's fields contained single quotation marks.
  - Fixed an issue where deleting a user would also delete an associated user group's permissions.
  - Fixed an issue that caused the 'Insert Survey' button to insert an unsubscribe link within a text only email campaign.
  - Fixed an issue where the application tried to free a resource that didn't exist, causing a "Resource is not really a resource" error.
  - Fixed an issue where adding options to a 'Picklist' custom field would generate a JavaScript error.
  - Fixed an issue when searching contacts causing the application to redirect to the 'All Contacts' view.
  - Fixed an issue where upgrading the product to a new version prevented users from using the drop down actions on the "View Contact Lists" page.
  - Fixed an issue that caused the navigation menu to intermittently break.
  - Fixed an issue where deleting a split test campaign would also delete all that split test's statistics.
  - Fixed an issue where the application would fail to "Remember Details" on the user login page.
  - Fixed behavior of custom fields and default values.  The application will display data from subscribers_data table for custom fields or display nothing, rather than showing default values in View, Edit, and Export.  Brought behavior into consistency with database, and with filters/searches.
  - Fixed an issue that prevented the dynamic content tag edit form from displaying correctly.
  - Fixed an issue where importing an email campaign from an external URL when the WYSIWYG editor is disabled causes a JavaScript error.

  - Fixed an issue that prevented the application from storing URLs longer than 255 characters long.

  - Fixed an issue that caused links within Custom Fields not to be tracked in the statistics.
  - Fixed an issue that caused links within Dynamic Content Tags not to be tracked in the statistics.
  - Fixed an issue that prevented the application from displaying certain built-in templates.
  - Fixed an issue that prevented users from archiving email campaigns.
  - Fixed an issue that prevented the WYSIWYG editor's "Get text content from editor" button from copying over foreign characters into the Text Version of an email campaign.
  - Fixed an issue that caused the sending status of email campaigns to hang at "in progress".
  - Fixed an issue that prevented jobs marked as complete from deduct credits.
  - Fixed an issue where the Statistics Pages failed to remember the "Results per page:" setting.
  - Fixed an issue where the "Yes, force all campaigns and autoresponders to be spam checked before they can be sent" option failed to force email campaigns and autoresponders to check for spam.
  - Fixed an issue that prevented users from making their own custom email templates "Active".
  - Fixed algorithm errors in Contact List statistics table data.
  - Fixed contact list statistics graph display problem caused by sign error.
  - Fixed handling of minus sign in Segments and Search Contacts.
  - Fixed an issue where a Survey's introductory text or instructions would truncate all characters proceeding the use of an apostrophe.
  - Fixed an issue where exporting contacts to a CSV file resulted in a blank file or an empty file containing only the CSV headers.
  - Fixed an issue where the WYSIWYG editor inserted extraneous paragraphs when importing some HTML files using Internet Explorer.
  - Upgraded TinyMCE from version 3.2.7 to 3.3.8.
  - Fixed an issue where the WYSIWYG editor failed to properly encode characters.
  - Fixed an issue where whitespace or new line characters caused dynamic content blocks to generate a JavaScript error, preventing them from loading.
  - Fixed an issue that prevented WebKit and Opera browsers from saving dynamic content tags.
  - Fixed an issue where certain PHP environment configurations would attempt to autoload /admin/functions/sendstudio_functions.php.
  - Fixed an issue where %%todaysdate%% failed to interpolate in the web version of an email campaign.
  - Fixed an issue where the use of brackets or commas in campaign names would cause statistics charts to incorrectly offset the display of data.

  - Fixed an issue that prevented the survey editor to copy a paragraph of text.
  - Fixed an issue where files uploaded from a Survey were generating 404 Not Found errors.
  - Fixed TinyMCE image upload so that user is notified when they attempt to upload duplicate files.
  - Changed upload directory do be user's image manager directory, to further avoid confusion around duplicate image names.
  - Fixed an issue that prevented multiple email campaigns, autoresponders, triggers, etc, from being edited simultaneously in separate browser tabs.  Doing so would cause one of the edited items to retain properties of the other.

Version: 6.0.2
Released: 11th December, 2009

Bugs Fixed:
  - Add fix for notice in survey addon permissions.
  - Fix issue where hourly limits were not being throttled and were showing a notice saying the user has gone over their limit. Emails are not throttled to the specified hourly rate on the group.
  - Fix a potential issue in autoloading function when class is checked for existence. Since the default behavior of class_exists is to autoload, the second parameter needed to be set to false so that the class isn't attempted to be autoloaded.
  - Fix when exporting contacts where the filtering options weren't working properly and always took the user to the filter page.
  - Simplify UI on contact exporting page. Instead of 2 radio buttons, there is now a single checkbox that shows the option to either filter or not. Bey default, filtering is disabled.

Version: 6.0.0
Released: 25th November, 2009

Bugs Fixed:
  - Content wasn't being properly encoded. Added a call to htmlentities() so that the content being pulled out of the database is properly encoded for a textarea (thus being correctly displayed in TinyMCE).
  - Fixes an issue where the Split Test Cron settings weren't appearing to save.
  - Remove old TinyMCE and replace with a jQuery build of TinyMCE (faster, smaller, etc.)
  - Add check for gd library when displaying the CAPTCHA option in website forms. If GD is present, the use of a CAPTRCHA is available, if not, then CAPTCHA's are disabled.
  - Add ability to specify an admin username during the installation process both in the installer and XML API installer.
  - Fix issues relating to user permission checking that was causing the admin user to not be saved. Also implemented a check to see if the user that is being edited is able to have their user group changed.
  - Adding security check to see if addon is enabled or not.
  - Fix issue with Checkbox Custom Field not being replaced correctly.
  - Fixed the custom field issue for triggers.
  - Fix issues related to user credit not being calculated/refunded correctly if a campaign is cancelled/deleted before sending.
  - Fix display issues with system logger addon configure settings page.
  - Fixed the issue with date input wasn't saved to database.
  - Update whitelabel to autodetect the version number in the footer copyright.
  - Update email templates with credits and new images.
  - Fix bug where email stats would be recorded before the campaign was actually sent.
